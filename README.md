# Abp Swagger Example

I reference yuzukwok's Abp.Web.Api.Swagger and I make to improve it.
####Thanks yuzukwok https://github.com/yuzukwok/aspnetboilerplate/tree/master/src/Abp.Web.Api.Swagger

if you use my example to browse Abp Api Doc.
####please use the url:http://yourhost:port/swagger

1. Use it to generate Api document of Abp.

2. Use it to generate WebApi document. 

#### I added two projects to my solution "NSwag.Core" and "NJsonSchema", Just use it to test,you can use Nuget to get them.

#### I integrated Swashbuckle to My Abp.Web.Api.Swagger, Thanks the Swashbuckle project.
